# Food Truck Project

### Week 2 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

## Description

This project creates an array of food trucks with the 
following characteristics: name, food type, rating, and id number.

It allows the user to input information about food trucks and then 
to display the information in a useful way. For example, the program 
calculates the average of all the food truck ratings and allows the 
user to see the average. It also determines the highest-rated food 
truck for the user to easily see.

Concepts in this project could be useful in an e-commerce application.

## Lessons Learned

I was faced with different challenges mainly having to do with scope 
and visibility in this project. I am not quite proficient using methods, 
and many times I sought to do things with the objects that were not possible 
due to self-imposed limitations. As a result of this project, I believe 
that I am starting to get a better understanding of what pass-by-value means.
